# Fluid Dynamics Projects

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and a final report from a university fluid dynamics course. The projects explore vortex and circulation calculations and simulate flow patterns in various scenarios.

## Contents

- **COMPUTE_CIRCULATION.m** – Computes circulation and vortex strength for different flow fields.
- **Uniform_Vortex_Flow.m** – Simulates uniform vortex flow around a point.
- **Vortex_In_a_Corner_Flow.m** – Models vortex flow in a corner geometry.
- **eq2latex.m** – Utility for converting equations to LaTeX.
- **equation_solver.m** – Solves equations related to fluid flow problems.
- **graph_attempt.m** – Example plotting script.
- **PHYS_599_Final_Report.pdf** – Final project report describing the theory, implementation, and results.

## Running the scripts

These scripts are written in MATLAB. To run them:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a script (e.g., `COMPUTE_CIRCULATION.m`) in MATLAB.
3. Run the script from the MATLAB editor or command window.

If you wish to convert the MATLAB code to Python or another language, you can refer to the comments in each script for guidance.
